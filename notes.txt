TODO: continue sorting recipes and need to still handle all distillates


naphtha is used for gasoline and made into isoprene which is used for natural rubber

Pyrolysis residual oils are tarlike byproducts
of the steam cracking of naphtha and gas oil to
produce alkenes

with pyht active add pitch to graphite rods


gasoline is an aromtic hydrocarbon mix.
the best gasoline is heavy on the alkanes

naphthalene is an aromatic but makes a low grade "straight run" gasoline like naphtha. low grade == low output for the recipes


add ammonia to syngas recipe in whichever mod adds ammonia
check for e hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide in later mods
otherwise use acidgas

More research on acetylene as chemical feed stock

. Hightemperature tar can be fractionally distilled;
three oil cuts are taken and a solid residue remains [33], [116]:
1) Light oil (bp < 200 ◦C), composed primarily
of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and styrene.
2) Middle oil (bp < 370 ◦C), containing tar
acids (phenols), tar bases (e.g., pyridine, anilines, and quinolines), and neutral oils (naphthalene).
3) Heavy oil (bp < 550 ◦C), containing aromatic compounds, such as anthracene,
phenanthrene, carbazole, and chrysene.
4) Coal tar pitch (solid residue), consisting of a
wide range of polycondensed aromatic compounds; it can be used as a binder for coal
briquetting.

todo:


DONE:
middle oil: seperated into light, carbolic, and naphthalene oils


Coke handling:
